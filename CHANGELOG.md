## [1.2.0] - Unreleased

Turns Row-Template from one page into a collection of designs. A minor release:
Row stays the default design, and 3X-UI (>= 3.6.0) stays the only supported
panel.

### Added

- **Fifteen designs.** Row plus Editorial, Canvas, Prism, Terminal, Pulse,
  Brutal, Arcade, Sketch, Signature, Saffron, Pulse Nova, Prism Nova, Terminal
  Nova, and Arcade Nova. Every design is built from the same runtime and
  translations, so status, Connect, QR codes, the Configuration Explorer, and
  the five languages behave the same in each.
- **Choosing a design.** A fresh interactive install shows a design chooser
  (Enter keeps Row). `RT_TEMPLATE=<id>` picks one for a scripted install, and
  the manager's **Reconfigure → Template** changes it later. Updates keep the
  selected design.
- **Checksummed designs.** Each design ships in the release with its own
  SHA-256 checksum. `row-template verify` checks every installed design against
  its checksum and confirms the live page is the selected design.
- **Painted country flags.** The flags of Germany, France, the Netherlands,
  Japan, Sweden, and the United States are drawn with CSS, so they appear on
  Windows in Chromium-based browsers, which otherwise show the two letters
  (`DE`) instead of a flag. Other countries keep the platform's flag emoji.
- **Documentation site** in English, Persian, and Arabic: installation,
  configuration, a template gallery with real previews, branding, security,
  compatibility, a developer reference, and troubleshooting.
- **Panel shells for research.** The release carries each design's page shell
  for every panel in the registry under `shells/`: 3X-UI, PasarGuard (Jinja2)
  and Rebecca (pongo2). The installer does not place these files. PasarGuard
  and Rebecca are research targets, not supported panels, and there are no
  installation instructions for them.

### Changed

- **Panel database detection fails closed.** Row-Template previously used the
  first `x-ui.db` it found. It now uses the first database file that exists —
  the one `XUI_DB_FOLDER` names, then the default locations in order — and
  only if it is a real SQLite database. If that file is not, it is refused with
  a warning instead of silently moving on to another, possibly stale, database;
  activation then falls back to the manual instructions.
- **Live refresh accepts only its own data.** The status refresh now checks
  that a response carries the page's own fields before using it. An
  unexpected response stops the refresh and leaves the server-rendered figures
  in place, instead of repainting the page with wrong values.
- The country-code table is stored as a bitmap, saving about 800 bytes in
  every page.

### Internal

- Groundwork for installing on more than one panel: a normalized data
  contract, build-time adapters for 3X-UI, PasarGuard and Rebecca, a frozen
  panel interface, a transaction engine, a 3X-UI panel adapter, and a
  format-2 backup snapshot. No `row-template` command calls any of it yet;
  backups and rollback still use the 1.1.0 format.

### Development

- `npm test` first renders every design's fixture pages (`npm run
  fixtures:all`), so a fresh clone can run the suite; it needs Go 1.22 or
  newer.
- `npm run lint:sh` runs ShellCheck over every shell script.
- The test harness runs on Linux and on Windows with Git Bash.
- `tools/make-release.sh` is executable, as its usage line documents.
- Design records moved from the repository root to
  [`docs/design/`](docs/design/README.md), with an index.

### Compatibility

- Requires 3X-UI (MHSanaei) **>= 3.6.0**.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-30

Evolves the subscriber page into a connection and configuration hub. A minor,
backward-compatible release: the v1.0.0 experience (status, Copy subscription,
QR, and per-app Connect actions) is unchanged and extended.

### Added

- **Configuration Explorer.** A new "Configurations" section that lists each
  usable server on its own row — a country flag or monogram badge, the
  configuration name, and a protocol label — with per-configuration **View**
  (local QR code and copy) and **Copy** actions. When the list is long it gains
  a search box; exact-duplicate links are collapsed and malformed links are
  isolated rather than shown.
- **Protocol awareness** for VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks,
  Hysteria/Hysteria2, WireGuard, AmneziaWG, and Telegram MTProto, presented as
  proper-noun labels.
- **Restrained country badges** derived only from a valid ISO country code in a
  configuration's own label; a monogram is shown when there is no valid flag —
  the badge is never empty, and the country is never inferred from a host or IP.

### Improved

- Individual configurations are secret-aware: links stay masked until you open
  **View**, are never written to the console, and QR codes render locally with
  no external QR, geolocation, or telemetry requests.
- Configuration names and labels are always inserted as text, never as markup,
  keeping the page safe against hostile link fragments; links are isolated for
  correct left-to-right display within right-to-left interfaces.
- Broader automated coverage: client-side URI parsing and classification, flag
  mapping, and explorer rendering, filtering, and XSS safety, plus expanded Go
  rendering fixtures (30 cases, including real WireGuard, AmneziaWG, MTProto,
  and Hysteria links, flags, bidirectional text, and large lists).
- The build size gate now warns at 185 KiB and fails only at 200 KiB
  (previously a hard failure at 185 KiB), matching the artifact's real budget
  while keeping a firm upper bound.

### Security

- The served page still makes no third-party requests. The Configuration
  Explorer adds no network calls, no external QR or geolocation lookups, and no
  telemetry, and it never logs subscriber links or identifiers.

### Compatibility

- Requires 3X-UI (MHSanaei) **>= 3.6.0**; validated against stock 3.7.0.
- Updating from v1.0.0 preserves your branding and configuration and keeps a
  restorable backup for rollback.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-30

First stable release.

### Added

- Self-contained custom subscription page for 3X-UI panels — a single HTML
  artifact with all CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and the QR generator inlined. No
  third-party CDNs and no external network requests from the served page.
- White-label branding: configurable service name, support link, and logo, all
  stored as data and injected safely (never executed).
- Five interface languages: English, فارسی, العربية, Русский, and 简体中文,
  with right-to-left support.
- One-command installer with a mandatory SHA-256 integrity check on every
  download (no skip path), safe archive extraction, and atomic activation.
- `row-template` manager with an interactive menu and direct commands:
  `config`, `update`, `rollback`, `verify`, `version`, `uninstall`, and `help`.
- Update checking against the public stable release channel, with graceful
  handling when the network or release source is unavailable.
- Backup and rollback: the previously installed version is snapshotted before an
  update and can be restored without losing branding configuration.

### Compatibility

- Requires 3X-UI (MHSanaei) **>= 3.6.0**; validated against stock 3.7.0.
- Recommended operating system: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (x86_64).
